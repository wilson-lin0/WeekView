[PA Write Up](https://markefontenot.notion.site/PA-05-8263d28a81a7473d8372c6579abd6481)

A simple but effective way to organize your life, with easy ways to track events and tasks.

Create a task and view it in the task queue, or create an event and watch them appear on the week view.

Write a quick note to yourself, or have an inspirational note to pick you up. Sort tasks and events by name or duration,
and see how your week's progressing with the overview. 

Change your layout to the vertical layout, or add some links to your bullet journal.

SOLID Principles Application:

S: We have controllers for each scene; for example, we have an AddTaskController that controls the popup, and that 
class's only responsibility is to control what happens with the AddTaskController.

O: We have multiple interfaces and abstract classes, which makes it easier to extend the program without modification.
For example, our controller interface and AbstractController class makes it easy to add additional controllers for 
each scene without modifying any other controllers.

L: All our classes that extend AbstractController can be replaced by AbstractController. Thus, AbstractController can
replace the subclass, but each subclass of AbstractController, i.e. AddEventController, cannot replace
AbstractController.

I: All our controllers that implement our Controller Interface use all the methods in the interface. No class that
does not need the method run() implements the Controller Interface.

D: All our classes depend on interfaces or abstract classes instead of other classes of the same level. For example,
our ViewImpl depends on our Controller Interface instead of a specific controller.
